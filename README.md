# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Demo version is deployed here: https://jme-react-blog.netlify.app/

Still not finished :]

For this project I used:

- React.JS
- Hooks, Router
- SASS
- Axios library
- Postman for testing responses from endpoints
